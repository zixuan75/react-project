# :rainbow: The React:laughing: Project: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/zixuan75/react-project/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/zixuan75/react-project?branch=master)

Welcome to The React Project!!:2nd_place_medal:

Now, this has REACT in in it, so make sure you have NPM and Nodejs instaled.

JSX syntax occured? Remember to start npm using:

> npm start

## Remember

Remember, we're using React, so it's going to render those components with the id="component name" unless if you have React Devtools where you can see the jsx components.

(No React Devtools)

```html
<div id="App">
  <div id="Text"><p>...</p></div>
</div>
```

(React Devtools)

```jsx
<App>
  <Text>
    <p>...</p>
  </Text>
</App>
```
