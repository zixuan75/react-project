# :rainbow: The React:laughing: Project:stars:: [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/zixuan75/react-project/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/zixuan75/react-project?branch=master):fire:

Welcome to The React Project!!:2nd_place_medal:

## Run code

First of all, install NPM. Make sure you have NodeJS 6.0.0 or higher, and NPM 5.2.0 or higher.

Then run:

> npx create-react-app my-app

Next, extract the file you downloaded from my repository.

So then delete all of the files and folders in the my-app directory be sure not to delete the npm files and folders in the directory.

Then replace the files and folder that you've deleted with all of the files in this project.

Last, delete unneccsary files and folders on the directory by running these commands:

> rm -rf source*
>
> rm -rf .deal .github
>
> rm -rf PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
>
> rm -rf LICENSE 0a.png
>
> rm -rf _config.yml
>
> rm -rf contributing.md

Then, you can start npm using:

> npm start

And then go to https://localhost:8000 and the app should start.

## Remember

Remember, we're using React, so it's going to render those components with the id="component name" unless if you have React Devtools where you can look at the jsx components.

(No React Devtools)

```html
<div id="App">
  <div id="Text"><p>...</p></div>
</div>
```

(React Devtools)

```jsx
<App>
  <Text>
    <p>...</p>
  </Text>
</App>
```
