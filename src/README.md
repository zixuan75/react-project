# Hi there!

This is the file where our React files and stylesheets go. You'll see no connection between those React files and the HTML file because this is runned by React-Scripts. Now, NPM React-Scripts does not use script links because they already know which one to connect to from the public directory: the index.js in the src directory!

The page is particularly stylish because we have a lot of CSS rules. That's why you see it looking like a complete webpage. Also remember, "class" is now "className" because class is a reserved word in JS. This is pretty confusing for new React users. Those questions like "Why is it a reserved word" and "What really are reserved words" just pop up if you don't have a advanced JavaScript mashup :laughing:.

We're good to add more code but we also have to improve our code. So we're trying to, but we're approaching January 27th which is the deadline. There is still a month before when #24 should be closed. So we still need to work a lot before #24 gets closed.

Note: It has been shut down a bit lately but we're back now.
